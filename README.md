# AI-Powered Sales Assistant 🎙️💼

## Overview
This project is a **speech-based AI Sales Assistant** designed to simulate real-world sales conversations. Users can interact with the assistant using voice input. The system converts speech to text, analyzes customer intent, and responds intelligently using text-to-speech. All interactions are stored in a structured JSON format, and a simple UI enables smooth user interaction.
